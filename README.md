# Study Case with different problems to solve

Please look into each folder containing the answer to all the specific problems.

## Python

Because my lack of knowledge I couldn't make the JSON problem in Python but I did it in JS.

All the other problems are made both in python and JS.

I try to apply the best possible approach thinking with BigO for the time and space complexity.

## JS

Here you will find the answers to the problems of the JavaScript section.

Same as the Python folder I try to have the best possible approach with BigO in mind.

## SQL

Here are the queries for the SQL answers.

I tested this queries in [sandboxsql](https://sandboxsql.com/).

## React

I didn't try to make anything fancy here, just something that could possibly make what it was expected.

I could distribute the folder and components better to create a more reusable components but I didn't wanted to spend more time on those things if is not needed.

I am rusty on the UI side. I tried different approaches with FlexBox and CSSGrid but I ended up creating a 2D array.

Is not the expected behavior but is close too.
